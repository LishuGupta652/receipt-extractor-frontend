# Engineering Assessment Frontend (React)

## Project Initialization

1. Clone this repository locally

2. Create a new working branch (e.g. `git checkout -b working-branch`)

3. Set your node environment

   - Run `nvm install && nvm use`, or

   - Alternatively manually set your node to v18+ and npm to v10+

4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

   Note: Ensure you have properly set your node version before this step

5. Run `npm run dev` to spin-up the frontend

   The terminal should display the port to view the frontend application in your browser (e.g. `http://localhost:5173/`).

   You can check that the frontend is running correctly by opening the provided url in your browser, where you should see a simple "Hello World" landing page.

## Project Work

1. Complete all of your work in the working branch that you created above

2. Push commits to your remote working branch as often as you need

## Project Submission

When you are ready to submit your work:

1. Create a PR into `main` branch

2. Merge the above PR

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: The above action is a one-time submission event. Do not open a PR until you are ready to submit your project.**
